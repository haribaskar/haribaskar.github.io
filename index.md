I'm working as datascientist past 2 years, I like to solve challenging complex problems and provide optimal solution to grow the business.

**Following projects are i worked on:**
1) Churn prediction and performance attrition - Classification and Regression
   - Used Survival analysis, HMM, Tree based models are Randomforest, XGBoost and RNN
2) Interpreting models - Explaining prediction on individual records
   - Shapley values, Lime, Eli5 
3) Chat Bot - IT Help desk, Health Bot
   - Pipeline of Tokenization, POS tagging, Stop words removal, Stemming and lemmatization
   - Intent classification
   - Entity Indentification
   - Build a minimal Utterence generator
4) Image classification and Object recognition
   - Used Inception v3 model and retrained last layer of softmax
   - YOLO
5) Bill details extraction through invoice using machine learning (No Regex)
   - Tesseract to get content and bounding box coordinates
   - Applied KNN on coordinates to get related content
6) Anomaly detection
   - Used HBOS, Denoising Autoencoder, Decision Tree
   - Build Api Server using spray and worker node by Undertow
7) Handwritten tamil character recognition
   - Used opencv to extract content and region of bounding box
   - Using Knearest found the closely matched letter
   
**Technolgy Stack:**

Languages : Python, Java, C 

DataBase: SQL, MongoDB, HBase

Familiar with: ELK stack, Redis, Spark

Libraries: Numpy, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Spark-ml, Pandas, Open-CV

Devops: VSTS, Git, Jenkins

Cloud: Azure, GCP

**Apart from that datascience, i worked on following during my college**
1) Developed weather app in android
2) Teacher tool - Managing student attendance and course materials
3) Crime Control app - social network for sharing crimes happening around us and informing others. And Geotagging the crimes.
4) Prestashop extension - Open source Ecommerece platform 

**On Security wise,**
1. Found a security vulnerability on ISP, reported back to them.
2. Reported sensitive information leakage and security threats within organisation.
